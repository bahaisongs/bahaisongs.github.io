    <h1>Privacy Policy for Bahá’í Songs</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22-04-2025</p>

    <p>Bahá’í Songs ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how the
        Bahá’í Songs app handles user information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No account registration or login is required.</li>
        <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact lists.</li>
        <li>We do not request access to your microphone, camera, location, or files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Non-Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We may collect <strong>anonymous usage data</strong> via standard mobile analytics tools (e.g., Google Play
        Console) to help improve the app. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>Anonymous crash or error reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is <strong>not linked to your identity</strong> and is used only to improve app performance and
        stability.</p>

    <h2>3. Audio Playback</h2>
    <p>The app provides access to a curated collection of Bahá’í songs. All audio files are stored directly on your
        device during installation, and playback occurs locally. <strong>No streaming is used, and no playback history
            is stored or transmitted</strong> to our servers.</p>
    <h2>4. Media Delivery and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Bahá’í Songs app uses <strong>Cloudflare R2</strong>, a secure object storage service, to host the audio and
        media files. These files are downloaded to the device as part of the app installation process.</p>
    <p>The app does <strong>not stream audio</strong> during playback, and no media files are fetched from the internet
        after installation.</p>
    <p>During app updates or when checking for the latest version, the app may access files from Cloudflare R2, in which
        case:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloudflare may collect <strong>non-identifying metadata</strong> (e.g., IP address, device type, timestamp)
            for security and performance monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>This information is handled in accordance with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
                                                              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare’s
            Privacy Policy</a> and is <strong>not used for advertising or tracking</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect or store this metadata ourselves.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Bahá’í Songs app is designed for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from
        children under the age of 13. If you believe that such data may have been collected, please contact us and we
        will promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While we do not store user data, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the app and the systems we use are
        secure and protected from misuse, unauthorized access, or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted on our website or within the app.
        Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
